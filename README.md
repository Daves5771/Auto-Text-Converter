The Auto Text Converter is a powerful search-and-replace tool for Microsoft Word Documents.  It utilizes regular expressions, a feature missing in standard MS Office installations, as the heart of its search-and-replace engine.  With this application one can accomplish such tasks as capturing all of the URLs in a document, converting words of British spelling into their American equivalents and vice-versa. The complexity and variety of the search and replacements one can make are only limited by oneâ€™s imagination.
